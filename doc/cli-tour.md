# A Short Tour of the Noms CLI

This is a quick introduction to the Noms command-line interface. It should only take a few minutes to read, but there's also a screencast if you prefer:

## Install Noms

... if you haven't already. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms#get-noms).

Now you should be able to run `noms`:

```
> noms

usage: noms [-no-pager] [command] [command-args]

Available commands:

  ds
  log
  show
  sync
  ui

See noms <command> -h for information on each available command.
```

## The `noms` command

Without any arguments, `noms` lists out all available commands. To get information on a specific command, we can suffix it with `-h`:

```
> noms sync -h
Moves datasets between or within databases.

noms sync [options] <source-object> <dest-dataset>

...
```

## Explore

There's a sample database running at http://demo.noms.io/cli-tour. Let's take a look inside...

The `noms ds` command lists the _datasets_ within a particular database:

```
> noms ds http://demo.noms.io/cli-tour

registered-businesses
fire-incidents
fire-permits
movie-locations
```

Noms datasets are versioned. You can see the history with `log`:

```
> noms log http://demo.noms.io/cli-tour:movie-locations

List<struct Row {
  ActorQ201: String
  ActorQ202: String
  ActorQ203: String
  Director: String
  Distributor: String
  FunQ20Facts: String
  Locations: String
...

sha1-b50c323c568bfff07a13fe276236cbdf40b5d846
Parent: sha1-4883ff49f930718f7aafede265b51f83c99cf7bc

  ActorQ201: String
  ActorQ202: String
  ActorQ203: String
  Director: String
  Distributor: String
  FunQ20Facts: String

...
```

Note that Noms is a typed system. What is being shown here is not text, but the first bit of a serialization of the structured data that Noms actually stores.

You can see the entire serialization of any object in the database with `noms show`:

```
> noms show http://demo.noms.io/cli-tour:sha1-20e6020b3f0b2728935e23f0e4c2d942e26b7ae1

struct Commit {
  parents: Set<Ref<Cycle<0>>>
  value: Value
}({
  parents: {
    sha1-b50c323c568bfff07a13fe276236cbdf40b5d846,
  },
  value: [
    Row {
      ActorQ201: "Siddarth",
      ActorQ202: "Nithya Menon",
      ActorQ203: "Priya Anand",
      Director: "Jayendra",
      Distributor: "",
      FunQ20Facts: "",
      Locations: "Epic Roasthouse (399 Embarcadero)",
      ProductionQ20Company: "SPI Cinemas",
      ReleaseQ20Year: "2011",
      SmileQ20AgainQ2CQ20JennyQ20Lee: "",
      Title: "180",
      Writer: "Umarji Anuradha, Jayendra, Aarthi Sriram, & Suba ",
    },
```

## Sync

You can work with Noms databases that are remote exactly the same as you work with local databases. But it's frequently useful to move data to a local machine, for example, if you intend to make local changes.

Moving data in Noms is done with the `sync` command. Note that unlike Git, we do not make a distinction between _push_ and _pull_. It's the same operation in both directions:

```
> noms sync http://demo.noms.io/cli-tour:film-locations ldb:/tmp/noms:films
> noms ds ldb:/tmp/noms
films
```

We can now make an edit locally:

```
> cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/attic-labs/noms/clients/go/csv
> go install ./...
> csv-export ldb:/tmp/noms:films /tmp/film-locations.csv
```

open /tmp/film-location.csv and edit it, then:

```
> csv-import /tmp/film-location.csv ldb:/tmp/noms:films
```

`noms show ldb:/tmp/noms:films` should now include your change!

`noms diff` [coming soon](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/1272) to make this more clear.
