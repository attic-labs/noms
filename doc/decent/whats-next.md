# What's next for Noms?

Our primary goal (as of 9/2017) is to **find users to drive the future
direction of Noms**. If there's something specific that you'd like to
see or a roadblock with Noms that you'd like removed, please let us know by
reaching out to us by email ([noms@attic.io](mailto:noms@attic.io)) or 
slack ([slack.noms.io](http://slack.noms.io)).

We are currently working on:

* Network & discovery: discovery of peers and broadcasting state is
  presently outside the scope of noms. We are however considering the
  best ways to support these features (ethereum, blockstack, etc).
* Business logic: weâ€™re considering the best way to support
  decentralized enforcement of business logic. Some possibilities
  include ACLs, blockchain-based consensus, and verifiable computing.
* Noms v8: we have a bunch of performance improvements going into the
  next release of Noms (10/2017)
