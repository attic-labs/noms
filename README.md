*Noms* is a decentralized database based on ideas from Git.

This repository contains two reference implementations of the databaseâ€”one in Go, and one in JavaScript. It also includes a number of tools and sample applications.

## About Noms

Noms is different from other databases. It is:

* *Content-addressed*. If you have some data you want to put into Noms, you don't have to worry about whether it already exists. Duplicate data is automatically ignored. There is no update, only insert.

* *Append-only*. When you commit data to Noms, you aren't overwriting anything. Instead you're adding to a historical record. By default, data is never removed from Noms. You can see the entire history of the database, diff any two commits, or rewind to any previous point in time.

* *Strongly-typed*. Noms doesn't have schemas that you design up front. Instead, each version of a Noms database has a *type*, which is generated automatically as you add data. You can write code against the type of a Noms database, confident that you've handled all the cases you need to.

* *Decentralized*. If I give you a copy of my database, you and I can modify our copies disconnected from each other, and come back together and merge our changes efficiently and correctly days, weeks, or years later.

- *Incomplete*. This is a somewhere between alpha and beta software. We are fairly confident in the core format, but major features like queries, concurrency, and GC are not yet implemented. Please keep a separate backup of data outside of Noms until we reach 1.0.

## Setup

Noms is supported on Mac OS X and Linux. Windows usually works, but isn't officially supported.

1. Install [Go 1.6+](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Ensure your [$GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) is configured
3. Type type type:
```
git clone https://github.com/attic-labs/noms $GOPATH/src/github.com/attic-labs/noms
go install github.com/attic-labs/noms/cmd/noms

noms log http://demo.noms.io/cli-tour::sf-film-locations
```

## What Noms is Good For

#### Data Version Control

Noms gives you the entire Git workflow, but for large-scale structured (or unstructured) data. Fork, merge, track history, efficiently synchronize changes, etc.

#### An Application Database with History

A database where every change is automatically and efficiently preserved. Instantly revert to, fork, or work from any historical commit.

#### An Archival Database

Trivially import snapshots from any format or API. Data is automatically versioned and deduplicated. Track the history of each datasource. Search across data sources.

## Status

**Noms is in beta. Please keep a backup of important data in some other store.**

We are working toward a 1.0, after which time we will remove this warning and guarantee format stability.
