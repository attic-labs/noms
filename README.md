# Noms

Noms is a content-addressable, immutable, peer-to-peer datastore for structured data.a

In other words, *noms is git for structured data*.

This repository will contain the reference implementation of the noms protocol, and will eventually be open sourced. 

This includes:

* Go wrappers for all the core Nom types
* Support for generating Go types from Nom schema definitions
* Chunking and dechunking
* Serialization and deserialization
* Chunkstore interface as well as several sample implementations
* Search support
* Sample applications
