// BatchStore provides an interface similar to chunks.ChunkStore, but batch-oriented. Instead of Put(), it provides SchedulePut(), which enqueues a Chunk to be sent at a possibly later time.
type BatchStore interface {
	// Get returns from the store the Value Chunk by h. If h is absent from the store, chunks.EmptyChunk is returned.

	// SchedulePut enqueues a write for the Chunk c with the given refHeight. Typically, the Value which was encoded to provide c can also be queried for its refHeight. The call may or may not block until c is persisted. The provided hints are used to assist in validation. Validation requires checking that all refs embedded in c are themselves valid, which could naively be done by resolving each one. Instead, hints provides a (smaller) set of refs that point to Chunks that themselves contain many of c's refs. Thus, by checking only the hinted Chunks, c can be validated with fewer read operations.
