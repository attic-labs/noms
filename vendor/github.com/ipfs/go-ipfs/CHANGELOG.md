# go-ipfs changelog

### 0.4.11 2017-09-14

Ipfs 0.4.11 is a larger release that brings many long-awaited features and
performance improvements. These include new datastore options, more efficient
bitswap transfers, greatly improved resource consumption, circuit relay
support, ipld plugins, and more! Take a look at the full changelog below for a
detailed list of every change.

The ipfs datastore has, until now, been a combination of leveldb and a custom
git-like storage backend called 'flatfs'. This works well enough for the
average user, but different ipfs usecases demand different backend
configurations. To address this, we have changed the configuration file format
for datastores to be a modular way of specifying exactly how you want the
datastore to be structured. You will now be able to configure ipfs to use
flatfs, leveldb, badger, an in-memory datastore, and more to suit your needs.
See the new [datastore
documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/datastores.md)
for more information.

Bitswap received some much needed attention during this release cycle. The
concept of 'Bitswap Sessions' allows bitswap to associate requests for
different blocks to the same underlying session, and from that infer better
ways of requesting that data. In more concrete terms, parts of the ipfs
codebase that take advantage of sessions (currently, only `ipfs pin add`) will
cause much less extra traffic than before. This is done by making optimistic
guesses about which nodes might be providing given blocks and not sending
wantlist updates to every connected bitswap partner, as well as searching the
DHT for providers less frequently. In future releases we will migrate over more
ipfs commands to take advantage of bitswap sessions. As nodes update to this
and future versions, expect to see idle bandwidth usage on the ipfs network
go down noticably.

The never ending effort to reduce resource consumption had a few important
updates this release. First, the bitswap sessions changes discussed above will
help with improving bandwidth usage. Aside from that there are two important
libp2p updates that improved things significantly. The first was a fix to a bug
in the dial limiter code that was causing it to not limit outgoing dials
correctly. This resulted in ipfs running out of file descriptors very
frequently (as well as incurring a decent amount of excess outgoing bandwidth),
this has now been fixed. Users who previously received "too many open files"
errors should see this much less often in 0.4.11. The second change was a
memory leak in the DHT that was identified and fixed. Streams being tracked in
a map in the DHT weren't being cleaned up after the peer disconnected leading
to the multiplexer session not being cleaned up properly. This issue has been
resolved, and now memory usage appears to be stable over time. There is still a
lot of work to be done improving memory usage, but we feel this is a solid
victory.

It is often said that NAT traversal is the hardest problem in peer to peer
technology, we tend to agree with this. In an effort to provide a more
ubiquitous p2p mesh, we have implemented a relay mechanism that allows willing
peers to relay traffic for other peers who might not otherwise be able to
communicate with each other.  This feature is still pretty early, and currently
users have to manually connect through a relay. The next step in this endeavour
is automatic relaying, and research for this is currently in progress. We
expect that when it lands, it will improve the perceived performance of ipfs by
spending less time attempting connections to hard to reach nodes. A short guide
on using the circuit relay feature can be found
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#circuit-relay).

The last feature we want to highlight (but by no means the last feature in this
release) is our new plugin system. There are many different workflows and
usecases that ipfs should be able to support, but not everyone wants to be able
to use every feature. We could simply merge in all these features, but that
causes problems for several reasons: first off, the size of the ipfs binary
starts to get very large very quickly. Second, each of these different pieces
needs to be maintained and updated independently, which would cause significant
churn in the codebase. To address this, we have come up with a system that
allows users to install plugins to the vanilla ipfs daemon that augment its
capabilities. The first of these plugins are a [git
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/plugin/plugins/git/git.go)
that allows ipfs to natively address git objects and an [ethereum
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-eth) that lets ipfs ingest and operate
on all ethereum blockchain data. Soon to come are plugins for the bitcoin and
zcash data formats. In the future, we will be adding plugins for other things
like datastore backends and specialized libp2p network transports.
You can read more on this topic in [Plugin docs](docs/plugins.md)

In order to simplify its integration with fs-repo-migrations, we've switched
the ipfs/go-ipfs docker image from a musl base to a glibc base. For most users
this will not be noticable, but if you've been building your own images based
off this image, you'll have to update your dockerfile. We recommend a
multi-stage dockerfile, where the build stage is based off of a regular Debian or
other glibc-based image, and the assembly stage is based off of the ipfs/go-ipfs
image, and you copy build artifacts from the build stage to the assembly
stage. Note, if you are using the docker image and see a deprecation message,
please update your usage. We will stop supporting the old method of starting
the dockerfile in the next release.

Finally, I would like to thank all of our contributors, users, supporters, and
friends for helping us along the way. Ipfs would not be where it is without
you.

### 0.4.10 - 2017-06-27

Ipfs 0.4.10 is a patch release that contains several exciting new features,
bugfixes and general improvements. Including new commands, easier corruption
recovery, and a generally cleaner codebase.

The `ipfs pin` command has two new subcommands, `verify` and `update`. `ipfs
pin verify` is used to scan the repo for pinned object graphs and check their
integrity. Any issues are reported back with helpful error text to make error
recovery simpler.  This subcommand was added to help recover from datastore
corruptions, particularly if using the experimental filestore and accidentally
deleting tracked files.
`ipfs pin update` was added to make the task of keeping a large, frequently
changing object graph pinned. Previously users had to call `ipfs pin rm` on the
old pin, and `ipfs pin add` on the new one. The 'new' `ipfs pin add` call would
be very expensive as it would need to verify the entirety of the graph again.
The `ipfs pin update` command takes shortcuts, portions of the graph that were
covered under the old pin are assumed to be fine, and the command skips
checking them.

Next up, we have finally implemented an `ipfs shutdown` command so users can
shut down their ipfs daemons via the API. This is especially useful on
platforms that make it difficult to control processes (Android, for example),
and is also useful when needing to shut down a node remotely and you do not
have access to the machine itself.

`ipfs add` has gained a new flag; the `--hash` flag allows you to select which
hash function to use and we have given it the ability to select `blake2b-256`.
This pushes us one step closer to shifting over to using blake2b as the
default. Blake2b is significantly faster than sha2-256, and also is conjectured
to provide superior security.

We have also finally implemented a very early (and experimental) `ipfs p2p`.
This command and its subcommands will allow you to open up arbitrary streams to
other ipfs peers through libp2p. The interfaces are a little bit clunky right
now, but shouldn't get in the way of anyone wanting to try building a fully
peer to peer application on top of ipfs and libp2p. For more info on this
command, to ask questions, or to provide feedback, head over to the [feedback
issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3994) for the command.

A few other subcommands and flags were added around the API, as well as many
other requested improvements. See below for the full list of changes.

### 0.4.9 - 2017-04-30

Ipfs 0.4.9 is a maintenance release that contains several useful bugfixes and
improvements. Notably, `ipfs add` has gained the ability to select which CID
version will be output. The common ipfs hash that looks like this:
`QmRjNgF2mRLDT8AzCPsQbw1EYF2hDTFgfUmJokJPhCApYP` is a multihash. Multihashes
allow us to specify the hashing algorithm that was used to verify the data, but
it doesn't give us any indication of what format that data might be. To address
that issue, we are adding another couple of bytes to the prefix that will allow us
to indicate the format of the data referenced by the hash. This new format is
called a Content ID, or CID for short. The previous bare multihashes will still
be fully supported throughout the entire application as CID version 0. The new
format with the type information will be CID version 1. To give an example,
the content referenced by the hash above is "Hello Ipfs!". That same content,
in the same format (dag-protobuf) using CIDv1 is
`zb2rhkgXZVkT2xvDiuUsJENPSbWJy7fdYnsboLBzzEjjZMRoG`.

CIDv1 hashes are supported in ipfs versions back to 0.4.5. Nodes running 0.4.4
and older will not be able to load content via CIDv1 and we recommend that they
update to a newer version.

There are many other use cases for CIDs. Plugins can be written to
allow ipfs to natively address content from any other merkletree based system,
such as git, bitcoin, zcash and ethereum -- a few systems we've already started work on.

Aside from the CID flag, there were many other changes as noted below:

### 0.4.8 - 2017-03-29

Ipfs 0.4.8 brings with it several improvements, bugfixes, documentation
improvements, and the long awaited directory sharding code.

Currently, when too many items are added into a unixfs directory, the object
gets too large and you may experience issues. To pervent this problem, and
generally make working really large directories more efficient, we have
implemented a HAMT structure for unixfs. To enable this feature, run:
```
ipfs config --json Experimental.ShardingEnabled true
```

And restart your daemon if it was running.

Note: With this setting enabled, the hashes of any newly added directories will
be different than they previously were, as the new code will use the sharded
HAMT structure for all directories. Also, nodes running ipfs 0.4.7 and earlier
will not be able to access directories created with this option.

That said, please do give it a try, let us know how it goes, and then take a

### 0.4.7 - 2017-03-15

Ipfs 0.4.7 contains several exciting new features!
First off, The long awaited filestore feature has been merged, allowing users
the option to not have ipfs store chunked copies of added files in the
blockstore, pushing to burden of ensuring those files are not changed to the
user. The filestore feature is currently still experimental, and must be
enabled in your config with:
```
ipfs config --json Experimental.FilestoreEnabled true
```
before it can be used. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3397#issuecomment-284337564) for more details.

Next up, We have merged initial support for ipfs 'Private Networks'. This
feature allows users to run ipfs in a mode that will only connect to other
peers in the private network. This feature, like the filestore is being
released experimentally, but if you're interested please try it out.
Instructions for setting it up can be found
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3397#issuecomment-284341649).

This release also enables support for the 'mplex' stream muxer by default. This
stream multiplexing protocol was available previously via the
`--enable-mplex-experiment` daemon flag, but has now graduated to being 'less
experimental' and no longer requires the flag to use it.

### 0.4.4 - 2016-10-11

This release contains an important hotfix for a bug we discovered in how pinning works.
If you had a large number of pins, new pins would overwrite existing pins.
Apart from the hotfix, this release is equal to the previous release 0.4.3.

- Fix bug in pinsets fanout, and add stress test. (@whyrusleeping, [ipfs/go-ipfs#3273](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/3273))

### 0.4.3-rc1 - 2016-07-23

This is a maintenance release which comes with a couple of nice enhancements, and improves the performance of Storage, Bitswap, as well as Content and Peer Routing. It also introduces a handful of new commands and options, and fixes a good bunch of bugs.

This is the first Release Candidate. Unless there are vulnerabilities or regressions discovered, the final 0.4.3 release will happen about one week from now.

- Security Vulnerability

  - The `master` branch if go-ipfs suffered from a vulnerability for about 3 weeks. It allowed an attacker to use an iframe to request malicious HTML and JS from the API of a local go-ipfs node. The attacker could then gain unrestricted access to the node's API, and e.g. extract the private key. We fixed this issue by reintroducing restrictions on which particular objects can be loaded through the API (@lgierth, [ipfs/go-ipfs#2949](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2949)), and by completely excluding the private key from the API (@Kubuxu, [ipfs/go-ipfs#2957](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2957)). We will also work on more hardening of the API in the next release.
  - **The previous release 0.4.2 is not vulnerable. That means if you're using official binaries from [dist.ipfs.io](https://dist.ipfs.io) you're not affected.** If you're running go-ipfs built from the `master` branch between June 17th ([ipfs/go-ipfs@1afebc21](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/commit/1afebc21f324982141ca8a29710da0d6f83ca804)) and July 7th ([ipfs/go-ipfs@39bef0d5](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/commit/39bef0d5b01f70abf679fca2c4d078a2d55620e2)), please update to v0.4.3-rc1 immediately.
  - We are grateful to the group of independent researchers who made us aware of this vulnerability. We wanna use this opportunity to reiterate that we're very happy about any additional review of pull requests and releases. You can contact us any time at security@ipfs.io (GPG [4B9665FB 92636D17 7C7A86D3 50AAE8A9 59B13AF3](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x50AAE8A959B13AF3)).

  - There is now documentation for the configuration options in `docs/config.md`. (@whyrusleeping, [ipfs/go-ipfs#2974](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2974))
  - All commands now sanely handle the combination of stdin and optional flags in certain edge cases. (@lgierth, [ipfs/go-ipfs#2952](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2952))

### 0.4.0 - 2016-04-05

This is a major release with plenty of new features and bugfixes.
It also includes breaking changes which make it incompatible with v0.3.x
on the networking layer.

* Major Changes
  * Multistream
    * The addition of multistream is a breaking change on the networking layer,
      but gives IPFS implementations the ability to mix and match different
      stream multiplexers, e.g. yamux, spdystream, or muxado.
      This adds a ton of flexibility on one of the lower layers of the protocol,
      and will help us avoid further breaking protocol changes in the future.
  * Files API
    * The new `files` command and API allow a program to interact with IPFS
      using familiar filesystem operations, namely: creating directories,
      reading, writing, and deleting files, listing out different directories,
      and so on. This feature enables any other application that uses a
      filesystem-like backend for storage, to use IPFS as its storage driver
      without having change the application logic at all.
  * Gx
    * go-ipfs now uses [gx](https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx) to manage its
      dependencies. This means that under the hood, go-ipfs's dependencies are
      backed by IPFS itself! It also means that go-ipfs is no longer installed
      using `go get`. Use `make install` instead.
* New Features
  * Web UI
    * Update to new version which is compatible with 0.4.0. (@dignifiedquire)
  * Networking
    * Implement uTP transport. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Allow multiple addresses per configured bootstrap node. (@whyrusleeping)
  * IPNS
    * Improve IPNS resolution performance. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Have dnslink prefer `TXT _dnslink.example.com`, allows usage of CNAME records. (@Kubuxu)
    * Prevent `ipfs name publish` when `/ipns` is mounted. (@noffle)
  * Repo
    * Improve performance of `ipfs add`. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Add `Datastore.NoSync` config option for flatfs. (@rht)
    * Implement mark-and-sweep GC. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Allow for GC during `ipfs add`. (@whyrusleeping)
    * Add `ipfs repo stat` command. (@tmg, @diasdavid)
  * General
    * Add support for HTTP OPTIONS requests. (@lidel)
    * Add `ipfs diag cmds` to view active API requests (@whyrusleeping)
    * Add an `IPFS_LOW_MEM` environment veriable which relaxes Bitswap's memory usage. (@whyrusleeping)
    * The Docker image now lives at `ipfs/go-ipfs` and has been completely reworked. (@lgierth)
* Security fixes
  * The gateway path prefix added in v0.3.10 was vulnerable to cross-site
    scripting attacks. This release introduces a configurable list of allowed
    path prefixes. It's called `Gateway.PathPrefixes` and takes a list of
    strings, e.g. `["/blog", "/foo/bar"]`. The v0.3.x line will not receive any
    further updates, so please update to v0.4.0 as soon as possible. (@lgierth)
* Incompatible Changes
  * Install using `make install` instead of `go get` (@whyrusleeping)
  * Rewrite pinning to store pins in IPFS objects. (@tv42)
  * Bump fs-repo version to 3. (@whyrusleeping)
  * Use multistream muxer (@whyrusleeping)
  * The default for `--type` in `ipfs pin ls` is now `all`. (@chriscool)

  * Remove msgio double wrap. (@jbenet)
  * Buffer msgio. (@whyrusleeping)
  * Perform various fixes to the FUSE code. (@tv42)
  * Compute `ipfs add` size in background to not stall add operation. (@whyrusleeping)
