# Contribute

go-libp2p is part of [The IPFS Project](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs), and is MIT licensed open source software. We welcome contributions big and small! Take a look at the [community contributing notes](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/contributing.md). Please make sure to check the [issues](https://github.com/ipfs/go-libp2p/issues). Search the closed ones
before reporting things, and help us with the open ones.

Guidelines:

- read the [libp2p spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs)
- please make branches + pull-request, even if working on the main repository
- ask questions or talk about things in [Issues](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues) or #ipfs on freenode.
- ensure you are able to contribute (no legal issues please-- we use the DCO)
- run `go fmt` before pushing any code
- run `golint` and `go vet` too -- some things (like protobuf files) are expected to fail.
- get in touch with @jbenet and @diasdavid about how best to contribute
- have fun!
