# js/counter

counter uses noms/js to read and write a simple incrementing counter.


## Getting Started

```
noms serve /tmp/noms &
cd ../../samples/js/counter
pushd ..
npm install
popd
npm install
node . http://localhost:8000:counter
```

You only need to do the `npm install` calls once. After that you can use `npm run build` or
`npm run start` for dev mode.
