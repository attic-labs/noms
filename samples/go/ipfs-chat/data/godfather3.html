</b>
<b>                         BEFORE TITLES:
</b>          The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a
          single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes
          faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow
          streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now,
          confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us
          and another, and as our surroundings become more
          visible, we discover that we are moving through a
          pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.
          suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves
          on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

          It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen
          Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at
          lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move
          toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past
          the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard
          dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main
          house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by
          a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named
          Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.
          As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the
          car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom
          Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business
          suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house
          and looks off.

<b>          HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE
</b>          Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.
          Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed
          for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to-
          ward us.

<b>          REVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY
</b>           As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he
           is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to
           keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the
          background, by the house 9 After a moment:

          There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and
          moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen.

          The heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane
          and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary,
          about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for
          travelling. As they put her into the car --

          the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie,
          Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto-
          matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The
          Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine
          passes through.

          As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going

          Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one

          in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy
          at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker --

          We are on the Drill Instructor who brandishes a
          Marine Corps knife, six-inch blade, brass knuckles
          incorporated into the handle.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR
</b>          This object is a United States

</b>          You.. You'd like to kill me,
          wouldn't you, Sir? Well, here's
          your chance.
          The Instructor tosses Tony the knife. Tony catches
          it. As they circle,. the Instructor taunts Tony.

          Make a face. Stick out your tongue.
          Do something, Mister Adams.
          Tony swings the knife. The Instructor avoids him.

</b>          My little bitty sister can make a

</b>          The Instructor offers a tempting target. Tony swings.
          The Instructor slaps his cap across Tony's face, grabs
          Tony's wrist and disarms him, throwing him to the
          ground.

          groin and goes down in a heap.

          and presses it to the Instrutor's throat.
