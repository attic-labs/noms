This program is a hack to simulate filecoin. It guarantees that chats get
replicated somewhere on the network.

Once filecoin exists, this won't be necessary.

Another approach in a blockstack-type world would be to make each user
have their own noms backend that they own/pay for. Then when a user chats,
the data goes into their own db, and they sync between them.
