# nomsfs

Nomsfs is a [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) filesystem built on Noms. To use it you'll need FUSE:

* *Linux* -- built-in; you should be good to go
* *Mac OS X* -- Install [FUSE for OS X](https://osxfuse.github.io/)

Development and testing have been done exclusively on Mac OS X using FUSE for OS X.
Nomsfs builds on the [Go FUSE imlementation](https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse) from Han-Wen Nienhuys.

## Usage

Make sure FUSE is installed. On Mac OS X remember to run `/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs`.


Build with `go build` (or just run with `go run nomsfs.go`); test with `go test`.

Mount an existing or new dataset by executing `nomsfs`:

```
$ mkdir /var/tmp/mnt
$ go run nomsfs.go /var/tmp/nomsfs::fs /var/tmp/mnt
running...
```

Use ^C to stop `nomsfs`

### Exploring The Data

1. Once you have a mount point and `nomsfs` is running you can add/delete/rename files and directories using the Finder or the command line as you would with any other file system.
2. Stop `nomsfs` with ^C
3. Let's look around the dataset:
```
> noms ds /var/tmp/nomsfs
fs
> noms show /var/tmp/nomsfs::fs
struct Commit {
  meta: struct {},
  parents: Set<Ref<Cycle<0>>>,
  value: struct Filesystem {

## Limitations

Hard links are not supported at this time, but may be added in the future.
Mounting a dataset in multiple locations is not supported, but may be added in the future.

## Troubleshooting

`Mount failed: no FUSE devices found`
Make sure FUSE is installed. If you're on Mac OS X make sure the kernel module is loaded by executing `/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs`.
